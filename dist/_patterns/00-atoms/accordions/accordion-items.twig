    <p>Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.</p>
    <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. I believe I never knew what the word round meant until I saw Earth from space.</p>
    <p>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</p>
    <p>Dinosaurs are extinct today because they lacked opposable thumbs and the brainpower to build a space program.</p>
    <p>I believe every human has a finite number of heartbeats. I don't intend to waste any of mine</p>
