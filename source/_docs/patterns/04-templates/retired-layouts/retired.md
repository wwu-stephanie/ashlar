Title: Retired layouts
---

These layout styles and definitions were created for the original Layout Builder templates. They all contain extraneous header/footer regions.

As of Drupal 8.7, the layouts included with Layout Builder are not only more simple in the UI, but offer a lot more flexibility and have most of the styles needed for multi-column layouts built into core.

These styles are being kept around for styling MABEL. Once MABEL has been upgraded to Drupal 9, or the templates for that theme have been swapped out, these can be removed.
