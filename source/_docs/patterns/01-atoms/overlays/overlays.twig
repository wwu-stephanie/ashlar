Overlays can be used to shade a block. They're typically used in conjunction with a block containing an image wrapped with the "background-image" class. When using an overlay, it's helpful to also set the block's background color with a background color class, so that the block inherits font colors and styles correctly. For example, for a blue background block, use class="blue-bg blue-overlay"

<div class="block blue-bg blue-overlay" style="width: 18.75rem; height: 100%; padding: 1.5rem;">
  <p>This block is using a gray image as it's background and has a blue overlay.</p>
  <p class="background-image">
    <img src="../../images/pattern-lab/placeholder.png" alt="gray placeholder">
  </p>
</div>

<div class="block dark-blue-bg dark-blue-overlay" style="width: 18.75rem; height: 100%; padding: 1.5rem;">
  <p>This block is using a gray image as it's background and has a dark blue overlay.</p>
  <p class="background-image">
    <img src="../../images/pattern-lab/placeholder.png" alt="gray placeholder">
  </p>
</div>

<div class="block black-bg box-headline" style="width: 18.75rem; height: 100%; padding: 1.5rem;">
  <p>This block is using a gray image as it's background and has a black overlay.</p>
  <p class="background-image">
    <img src="../../images/pattern-lab/placeholder.png" alt="gray placeholder">
  </p>
</div>

<div class="block gray-bg gray-overlay" style="width: 18.75rem; height: 100%; padding: 1.5rem;">
  <p>This block is using a gray image as it's background and has a gray overlay.</p>
  <p class="background-image">
    <img src="../../images/pattern-lab/placeholder.png" alt="gray placeholder">
  </p>
</div>
