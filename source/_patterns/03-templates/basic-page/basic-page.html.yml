                      <p class="intro">A paragraph (from the Ancient Greek παράγραφος <i>paragraphos</i>, "to write beside" or "written beside") is a self-contained unit of a discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.</p>
                      <h3 class="sans-serif">Widows and Orphans</h3>
                      <p>Widows and orphans occur when the first line of a paragraph is the last line in a column or page, or when the last line of a paragraph is the first line of a new column or page.</p>
                      <h3 class="sans-serif">Paragraph Break</h3>
                      <p>In word processing and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to be distinguished from the soft return at the end of a line internal to a paragraph. This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.</p>

                      <h4 class="sans-serif">Style advice</h4>
                      <p>Crafting of clear, coherent paragraphs is the subject of considerable stylistic debate</p>
                      <ul class="spaced">
                      <li>Form varies among different types of writing</li>
                      <li>A common English usage misconception is that a paragraph has three to five sentences; single-word paragraphs can be seen in some professional writing, and journalists often use single-sentence paragraphs.</li>
                      <li>A topic sentence or "main idea", preferably first</li>
                      <li>Multiple "supporting" or "detail" sentences which explain or supply evidence</li>
                      </ul>
                      </div>'
