title: Lightbox
---
Modal container for highlighting video, particularly for Make Waves video content. Replaces Featherlight functionality, but in a more accessible container.

The ashlar lightbox needs two attributes on the button to work properly:

1. *data-url:* this is the URL of the embedded video. This should work with both web video (YouTube/Vimeo) and locally-hosted video.
2. *data-title:* this is the name of the iframe needed for accessibility. See [Iframes need meaningful titles](https://designsystem.wwu.edu/accessibility/guide/iframes-need-meaningful-titles)
