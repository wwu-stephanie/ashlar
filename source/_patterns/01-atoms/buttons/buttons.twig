<p>The styles show here are for true buttons, which use either the &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input type="submit"&gt; HTML tags. They are typically used for things like form submissions, or to trigger some kind of action on a page. For consistent user experience, the styles that can be applied to real buttons are limited.</p>

<p>There are also styles that can be applied to link that make them look like what we think of as buttons. Those can be found under Atoms &gt; Links &gt; Button Styled.</p>

<button>Button</button>
<button class="alt">With .alt class</button>
<button class="warning">With .warning class</button>
<button disabled>Disabled Button</button>
