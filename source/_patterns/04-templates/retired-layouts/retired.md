Title: Retired layouts
---
These layout styles and definitions were created for the original Layout Builder templates. They all contain extraneous header/footer regions.

As of Drupal 8.7, the layouts included with Layout Builder are not only more simple in the UI, but offer a lot more flexibility and have most of the styles needed for multi-column layouts built into core.

These styles are being kept around for purposes of styling Drupal 7 Ashlar layouts (e.g. Huxley, Grad School, and MABEL), as well as for the Homepage and Design System sites which were built prior to Drupal 8.7.
