  <p>Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? Damage report! Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. What? We're not at all alike! Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.</p>"
